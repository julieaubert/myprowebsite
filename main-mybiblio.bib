In this context, we define a hidden Markov process that underlies all individuals jointly in order to detect and to classify genomics regions in different states (typically, deletion, normal or amplification). Structural variations from different individuals may be dependent. It is the case in agronomy where varietal selection program exists and species share a common phylogenetic past. We propose to take into account these dependencies inthe HMM model. When dealing with a large number of series, maximum likelihood inference (performed classically using the EM algorithm) becomes intractable. We thus propose an approximate inference algorithm based on a variational approach (VEM), implemented in the CHMM R package. A simulation study is performed to assess the performance of the proposed method and an application to the detection of structural variations in plant genomes is presented.},

	abstract = {Early embryogenesis relies on the translational regulation of maternally stored mRNAs. In sea urchin, fertilization triggers a dramatic rise in translation activity, necessary for the onset of cell division. Here, the full spectrum of the mRNAs translated upon fertilization was investigated by polysome profiling and sequencing. The translatome of the early sea urchin embryo gave a complete picture of the polysomal recruitment dynamics following fertilization. Our results indicate that only a subset of maternal mRNAs were selectively recruited onto polysomes, with over-represented functional categories in the translated set. The increase in translation upon fertilization depends on the formation of translation initiation complexes following mTOR pathway activation. Surprisingly, mTOR pathway inhibition differentially affected polysomal recruitment of the newly translated mRNAs, which thus appeared either mTOR-dependent or mTOR-independent. Therefore, our data argue for an alternative to the classical cap-dependent model of translation in early development. The identification of the mRNAs translated following fertilization helped assign translational activation events to specific mRNAs. This translatome is the first step to a comprehensive analysis of the molecular mechanisms governing translation upon fertilization and the translational regulatory networks that control the egg-to-embryo transition as well as the early steps of embryogenesis.},

Negative yeast-yeast interaction was observed between the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica 1E07 (YL1E07) and the yeast Debaryomyces hansenii 1L25 (DH1L25) in a model cheese but need elucidation. YL1E07 and DH1L25 were cultivated in mono and co-cultures in a liquid synthetic medium (SM) mimicking the cheese environment and the growth inhibition of DH1L25 in the presence of YL1E07 was reproduced. We carried out microbiological, biochemical (lactose, lactate, AA consumption and ammonia production) and transcriptomic analyses by microarray technology to highlight the interaction mechanisms. We showed that the DH1L25 growth inhibition in the presence of YL1E07 was neither due to the ammonia production nor to the nutritional competition for the medium carbon sources between the two yeasts. The transcriptomic study was the key toward the comprehension of yeast-yeast interaction, and revealed that the inhibition of DH1L25 in co-culture is due to a decrease of the mitochondrial respiratory chain functioning.},

Reciprocally plant metabolites can influence major life history traits in these insects and largely contribute to their fitness. Plant rhizospheric microorganisms are an important biotic factor modulating plant metabolites and adaptation to stress. While plant-insects or plant-microorganisms interactions and their consequences on the plant metabolite signature are well-documented, the impact of soil microbial communities on plant defenses against phytophagous insects remains poorly known. In this study, we used oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) as biological models to tackle this question. Even though D. radicum is a belowground herbivore as a larva, its adult life history traits depend on aboveground signals. We therefore tested whether soil microbial diversity influenced emergence rate and fitness but also fly oviposition behavior, and tried to link possible effects to modifications in leaf and root metabolites. Through a removal-recolonization experiment, 3 soil microbial modalities ("high," "medium," "low") were established and assessed through amplicon sequencing of 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA genes. The "medium" modality in the rhizosphere significantly improved insect development traits. Plant-microorganism interactions were marginally associated to modulations of root metabolites profiles, which could partly explain these results. We highlighted the potential role of plant-microbial interaction in plant defenses against Delia radicum. Rhizospheric microbial communities must be taken into account when analyzing plant defenses against herbivores, being either below or aboveground.},

We applied metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and biochemical analyses to an experimental surface-ripened cheese composed of nine microbial species during four weeks of ripening. By combining all of the data, we were able to obtain an overview of the cheese maturation process and to better understand the metabolic activities of the different community members and their possible interactions.

	abstract = {All organisms need to sense and respond to a range of stress conditions. In this study, we used transcriptional profiling to identify genes and cellular processes that are responsive during arsenite and tert-butyl hydroperoxide exposure in Kluyveromyces lactis. Many arsenite-responsive genes encode proteins involved in redox processes, protein folding and stabilization, and transmembrane transport. The majority of peroxide-responsive genes encode functions related to transcription, translation, redox processes, metabolism and transport. A substantial number of these stress-regulated genes contain binding motifs for the AP-1 like transcription factors KlYap1 and KlYap8. We demonstrate that KlYap8 binds to and regulates gene expression through a 13 base-pair promoter motif, and that KlYap8 provides protection against arsenite, antimonite, cadmium and peroxide toxicity. Direct transport assays show that Klyap8 Delta cells accumulate more arsenic and cadmium than wild type cells and that the Klyap8 Delta mutant is defective in arsenic and cadmium export. KlYap8 regulates gene expression in response to both arsenite and peroxide, and might cooperate with KlYap1 in regulation of specific gene targets. Comparison of KlYap8 with its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue ScYap8 indicates that KlYap8 senses and responds to multiple stress signals whereas ScYap8 is only involved in the response to arsenite and antimonite. Thus, our data suggest that functional specialization of ScYap8 has occurred after the whole genome duplication event. This is the first genome-wide stress response analysis in K. lactis and the first demonstration of KlYap8 function.},

	abstract = {Yarrowia lipolytica, located at the frontier of hemiascomycetous yeasts and fungi, is an excellent candidate for studies of metabolism evolution. This yeast, widely recognized for its technological applications, in particular produces volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) that fully contribute to the flavor of smear cheese. We report here a relevant global vision of sulfur metabolism in Y. lipolytica based on a comparison between high-and low-sulfur source supplies (sulfate, methionine, or cystine) by combined approaches (transcriptomics, metabolite profiling, and VSC analysis). The strongest repression of the sulfate assimilation pathway was observed in the case of high methionine supply, together with a large accumulation of sulfur intermediates. A high sulfate supply seems to provoke considerable cellular stress via sulfite production, resulting in a decrease of the availability of the glutathione pathway's sulfur intermediates. The most limited effect was observed for the cystine supply, suggesting that the intracellular cysteine level is more controlled than that of methionine and sulfate. Using a combination of metabolomic profiling and genetic experiments, we revealed taurine and hypotaurine metabolism in yeast for the first time. On the basis of a phylogenetic study, we then demonstrated that this pathway was lost by some of the hemiascomycetous yeasts during evolution.},

	abstract = {Propionibacterium freudenreichii is used as a ripening culture in Swiss cheese manufacture. It grows when cheeses are ripened in a warm room (about 24°C). Cheeses with an acceptable eye formation level are transferred to a cold room (about 4°C), inducing a marked slowdown of propionic fermentation, but P. freudenreichii remains active in the cold. To investigate the P. freudenreichii strategies of adaptation and survival in the cold, we performed the first global gene expression profile for this species. The time-course transcriptomic response of P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA1T strain was analyzed at five times of incubation, during growth at 30°C then for 9 days at 4°C, under conditions preventing nutrient starvation. Gene expression was also confirmed by RT-qPCR for 28 genes. In addition, proteomic experiments were carried out and the main metabolites were quantified. Microarray analysis revealed that 565 genes (25% of the protein-coding sequences of P. freudenreichii genome) were differentially expressed during transition from 30°C to 4°C (P,0.05 and |fold change|.1). At 4°C, a general slowing down was observed for genes implicated in the cell machinery. On the contrary, P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA1T strain over-expressed genes involved in lactate, alanine and serine conversion to pyruvate, in gluconeogenesis, and in glycogen synthesis. Interestingly, the expression of different genes involved in the formation of important cheese flavor compounds, remained unchanged at 4uC. This could explain the contribution of P. freudenreichii to cheese ripening even in the cold. In conclusion, P. freudenreichii remains metabolically active at 4uC and induces pathways to maintain its long-term survival.},

To understand the contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment to this phenomenon, we isolated ECM surrogate invading cell populations from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and studied their genotype and malignant phenotype. Methods: We isolated invasive subpopulations (INV) from non invasive populations (REF) using a 2D-Matrigel assay, a surrogate of basal membrane passage. INV and REF populations were investigated by microarray assay and for their capacities to adhere, invade and transmigrate in vitro, and to form metastases in nude mice. Results: REF and INV subpopulations were stable in culture and present different transcriptome profiles. INV cells were characterized by reduced expression of cell adhesion and cell-cell junction genes (44% of down regulated genes) and by a gain in expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic gene sets. In line with this observation, in vitro INV cells showed reduced adhesion and increased motility through endothelial monolayers and fibronectin. When injected into the circulation, INV cells induced metastases formation, and reduced injected mice survival by up to 80% as compared to REF cells. In nude mice, INV xenografts grew rapidly inducing vessel formation and displaying resistance to apoptosis. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the in vitro ECM microenvironment per se was sufficient to select for tumor cells with a stable metastatic phenotype in vivo characterized by loss of adhesion molecules expression and induction of proangiogenic and survival factors.},

In agreement with the growth of B. aurantiacum in the presence of sulfate and cystine, the metabolic reconstruction showed the presence of a sulfate assimilation pathway, thiolation pathways that produce cysteine (cysE and cysK) or homocysteine (metX and metY) from sulfide, at least one gene of the transsulfuration pathway (aecD), and genes encoding three MetE-type methionine synthases. We also compared the expression profiles of B. aurantiacum ATCC 9175 during sulfur starvation or in the presence of sulfate. Under sulfur starvation, 690 genes, including 21 genes involved in sulfur metabolism and 29 genes encoding amino acids and peptide transporters, were differentially expressed. We also investigated changes in pools of sulfur-containing metabolites and in expression profiles after growth in the presence of sulfate, cystine, or methionine plus cystine. The expression of genes involved in sulfate assimilation and cysteine synthesis was repressed in the presence of cystine, whereas the expression of metX, metY, metE1, metE2, and BL613, encoding a probable cystathionine-gamma-synthase, decreased in the presence of methionine. We identified three ABC transporters: two operons encoding transporters were transcribed more strongly during cysteine limitation, and one was transcribed more strongly during methionine depletion. Finally, the expression of genes encoding a methionine gamma-lyase (BL929) and a methionine transporter (metPS) was induced in the presence of methionine in conjunction with a significant increase in volatile sulfur compound production.},

	abstract = {Hemiascomycetes are separated by considerable evolutionary distances and, as a consequence, the mechanisms involved in sulfur metabolism in the extensively studied yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, could be different from those of other species of the phylum. This is the first time that a global view of sulfur metabolism is reported in the biotechnological yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. We used combined approaches based on transcriptome analysis, metabolome profiling, and analysis of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). A comparison between high and low sulfur source supplies, i.e., sulfate, methionine, or cystine, was carried out in order to identify key steps in the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the sulfur metabolism. We found that sulfur metabolism of K. lactis is mainly modulated by methionine. Furthermore, since sulfur assimilation is highly regulated, genes coding for numerous transporters, key enzymes involved in sulfate assimilation and the interconversion of cysteine to methionine pathways are repressed under conditions of high sulfur supply. Consequently, as highlighted by metabolomic results, intracellular pools of homocysteine and cysteine are maintained at very low concentrations, while the cystathionine pool is highly expandable. Moreover, our results suggest a new catabolic pathway for methionine to VSCs in this yeast: methionine is transaminated by the ARO8 gene product into 4-methylthio-oxobutyric acid (KMBA), which could be exported outside of the cell by the transporter encoded by PDR12 and demethiolated by a spontaneous reaction into methanethiol and its derivatives.},

	abstract = {The objective was to examine if IVF/ICSI repeated implantation failures (IF) or recurrent miscarriages (RM) could be related to preconceptional endometrial deregulations. IF was defined as the absence of pregnancy despite the transfer of at least ten IVF/ICSI good quality embryos, and RM as having at least three unexplained miscarriages. Fertile controls (FC) were women who had given birth at least once. Endometrial biopsy was performed in the mild luteal phase of a non-conceptual cycle (five women were selected in each group). Affymetrix chips (GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 Array) were used for hybridization. Data were normalized by the gcRMA method, and raw p values adjusted by the Bonferroni procedure (1%). Differential expression of selected genes was analysed using real-time PCR. Gene networks and biological functions were explored using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software. Endometrial gene expression profiles at the time of uterine receptivity differ dramatically in the endometrium among FC, RM, and IF patients. Compared to FC, 2126 and 2477 genes are differentially expressed in IF and RM groups, respectively, and 2363 between IF and RM. In both conditions, differential gene expression referred mainly to DNA transcription and expression. Other main cellular functions deregulated in IF conditions correspond to cell morphology, cellular development, cell cycle, and cellular assembly, while in RM conditions, deregulated cellular functions relate to cell signalling (degradation of cyclic AMP and calcium metabolism) and cellular maintenance. In both conditions, there is an over-representation of deregulations related to the haematological system. In the IF condition, cell-mediated immune response and nervous system development and function are highly deregulated, while in RM patients, main deregulations are in organ and tissue development, humoral immune response, and muscular system development and function. Extensive endometrial deregulations are present before conception in patients who experienced IF or RM with both distinct and common deregulation.},

	abstract = {Terminal differentiation of mammary tissue into a functional epithelium that synthesizes and secretes milk occurs during pregnancy. The molecular mechanisms underlying this complex process are poorly understood, especially in ruminants. To obtain an overview of the ruminant mammary gland's final differentiation process, we conducted time-course gene expression analysis of five physiological stages: four during pregnancy (P46, P70, P90, and P110) and one after 40 days of lactation (L40). An appropriate loop experimental design was used to follow gene expression profiles. Using three nulliparous (pregnancy) or primiparous (lactation) goats per stage, we performed a comparison starting from nine dye-swaps and using a 22K bovine oligoarray. Statistical analysis revealed that the expression of 1,696 genes varied significantly at least once in the study. These genes fell into 19 clusters based on their expression profiles. Identification of biological functions with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed several similarities, in keeping with physiological stages described in mice. As in mice, expression of milk protein genes began at midpregnancy, and genes regulating lipid biosynthesis were induced at the onset of lactation. During the first half of pregnancy, the molecular signature of goat mammary tissue was characterized by the expression of genes associated with tissue remodeling and differentiation, while the second half was mainly characterized by the presence of messengers encoding genes involved in cell proliferation. A large number of immune-related genes were also induced, supporting recent speculation that mammary tissue has an original immune function, and the recruitment of migrating hematopoietic cells possibly involved in the branching morphogenesis of the mammary gland. These data hint that the induction of differentiation occurs early in pregnancy, very likely before P46. This period is therefore crucial for obtaining a healthy and productive mammary gland.},

Using a 13,257-element bovine oligonucleotide array, we established expression profiles at day 20 of the estrous cycle or pregnancy (implantation), revealing 446 and 1,295 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in C and IC areas, respectively (false discovery rate = 0.08). The impact of the conceptus was higher on the immune response function in C but more prominent on the regulation of metabolism function in IC. The C vs. IC direct comparison revealed 1,177 and 453 DEG in cyclic and pregnant animals respectively (false discovery rate = 0.05), with a major impact of the conceptus on metabolism and cell adhesion. We selected 15 genes including C11ORF34, CXCL12, CXCR4, PLAC8, SCARA5, and NPY and confirmed their differential expression by quantitative RT-PCR. The cellular localization was analyzed by in situ hybridization and, upon pregnancy, showed gene-specific patterns of cell distribution, including a high level of expression in the luminal epithelium for C11ORF34 and MX1. Using primary cultures of bovine endometrial cells, we identified PTN, PLAC8, and CXCL12 as interferon-tau (IFNT) target genes and MSX1 and CXCR7 as IFNT-regulated genes, whereas C11ORF34 was not an IFNT-regulated gene. Our transcriptomic data provide novel molecular insights accounting for the biological functions related to the C or IC endometrial areas and may contribute to the identification of potential biomarkers for normal and perturbed early pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Implantation is crucial for placental development that will subsequently impact fetal growth and pregnancy success with consequences on postnatal health. We postulated that the pattern of genes expressed by the endometrium when the embryo becomes attached to the mother uterus could account for the final outcome of a pregnancy. As a model, we used the bovine species where the embryo becomes progressively and permanently attached to the endometrium from day 20 of gestation onwards. At that stage, we compared the endometrial genes profiles in the presence of an in vivo fertilized embryo (AI) with the endometrial patterns obtained in the presence of nuclear transfer (SCNT) or in vitro fertilized embryos (IVF), both displaying lower and different potentials for term development. Our data provide evidence that the endome-trium can be considered as a biological sensor able to fine-tune its physiology in response to the presence of embryos whose development will become altered much later after the implantation process. Compared with AI, numerous biological functions and several canonical pathways with a major impact on metabolism and immune function were found to be significantly altered in the endometrium of SCNT pregnancies at implantation, whereas the differences were less pronounced with IVF embryos. Determining the limits of the endometrial plasticity at the onset of implantation should bring new insights on the contribution of the maternal environment to the development of an embryo and the success of pregnancy. bovine ͉ implantation ͉ microarray ͉ nuclear transfer},

	abstract = {Most microarray studies are made using labelling with one or two dyes which allows the hybridization of one or two samples on the same slide. In such experiments, the most frequently used dyes are Cy3 and Cy5. Recent improvements in the technology (dye-labelling, scanner and, image analysis) allow hybridization up to four samples simultaneously. The two additional dyes are Alexa488 and Alexa494. The triple-target or four-target technology is very promising, since it allows more flexibility in the design of experiments, an increase in the statistical power when comparing gene expressions induced by different conditions and a scaled down number of slides. However, there have been few methods proposed for statistical analysis of such data. Moreover the lowess correction of the global dye effect is available for only two-color experiments, and even if its application can be derived, it does not allow simultaneous correction of the raw data. We propose a two-step normalization procedure for triple-target experiments. First the dye bleeding is evaluated and corrected if necessary. Then the signal in each channel is normalized using a generalized lowess procedure to correct a global dye bias. The normalization procedure is validated using triple-self experiments and by comparing the results of triple-target and two-color experiments. Although the focus is on triple-target microarrays, the proposed method can be used to normalize p differently labelled targets co-hybridized on a same array, for any value of p greater than 2. The proposed normalization procedure is effective: the technical biases are reduced, the number of false positives is under control in the analysis of differentially expressed genes, and the triple-target experiments are more powerful than the corresponding two-color experiments. There is room for improving the microarray experiments by simultaneously hybridizing more than two samples.},

While this strategy ensures an automatic correction of the gene-specific labelling bias, it also induces dependencies between log-ratio measurements that must be taken into account in the statistical analysis. Results: We present two original statistical procedures for the statistical analysis of individually balanced designs. These procedures are compared with the usual ML and REML mixed model procedures proposed in most statistical toolboxes, on both simulated and real data. Conclusion: The UP procedure we propose as an alternative to usual mixed model procedures is more efficient and significantly faster to compute.

	abstract = {Down syndrome caused by chromosome 21 trisomy is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in humans. Disruption of the phenotype is thought to be the result of gene-dosage imbalance. Variations in chromosome 21 gene expression in Down syndrome were analyzed in lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients and control individuals. Of the 359 genes and predictions displayed on a specifically designed high-content chromosome 21 microarray, one-third were expressed in lymphoblastoid cells. We performed a mixed-model analysis of variance to find genes that are differentially expressed in Down syndrome independent of sex and interindividual variations. In addition, we identified genes with variations between Down syndrome and control samples that were significantly different from the gene-dosage effect (1.5). Microarray data were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that 29% of the expressed chromosome 21 transcripts are overexpressed in Down syndrome and correspond to either genes or open reading frames. Among these, 22% are increased proportional to the gene-dosage effect, and 7% are amplified. The other 71% of expressed sequences are either compensated (56%, with a large proportion of predicted genes and antisense transcripts) or highly variable among individuals (15%). Thus, most of the chromosome 21 transcripts are compensated for the gene-dosage effect. Overexpressed genes are likely to be involved in the Down syndrome phenotype, in contrast to the compensated genes. Highly variable genes could account for phenotypic variations observed in patients. Finally, we show that alternative transcripts belonging to the same gene are similarly regulated in Down syndrome but sense and antisense transcripts are not.},

Its prime role is thought to be the reabsorption of filtered di- and tripeptides contributing to amino acid homeostasis. To elucidate the role of PEPT2 in renal amino acid metabolism we submitted kidney tissues of wild-type and a Pept2(-/-) mouse line to a comprehensive transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiling and analyzed urinary amino acids and dipeptides. cDNA microarray analysis identified 147 differentially expressed transcripts in transporter-deficient animals, and proteome analysis by 2D-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS identified 37 differentially expressed proteins. Metabolite profiling by GC-MS revealed predominantly altered concentrations of amino acids and derivatives. Urinary excretion of amino acids demonstrated increased glycine and cysteine/cystine concentrations and dipeptides in urine were assessed by amino acid analysis of urine samples before and after in vitro dipeptidase digestion. Dipeptides constituted a noticeable fraction of urinary amino acids in Pept2(-/-) animals, only, and dipeptide-bound glycine and cystine were selectively increased in Pept2(-/-) urine samples. These findings were confirmed by a drastically increased excretion of cysteinylglycine (cys-gly). Urinary loss of cys-gly together with lower concentrations of cysteine, glycine, and oxoproline in kidney tissue and altered expression of mRNA and proteins involved in glutathione (GSH) metabolism suggests that PEPT2 is predominantly a system for reabsorption of cys-gly originating from GSH break-down, thus contributing to resynthesis of GSH.},

	abstract = {Background: Thousands of genes in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, for detecting differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments. The expected proportion of false positive genes in a set of genes, called the False Discovery Rate (FDR), has been proposed to measure the statistical significance of this set. Various procedures exist for controlling the FDR. However the threshold (generally 5%) is arbitrary and a specific measure associated with each gene would be worthwhile. Results: Using process intensity estimation methods, we define and give estimates of the local FDR, which may be considered as the probability for a gene to be a false positive. After a global assessment rule controlling the false positive error, the local FDR is a valuable guideline for deciding wether a gene is differentially expressed. The interest of the method is illustrated on three well known data sets. A R routine for computing local FDR estimates from p-values is available at http:/ /www.inapg.fr/ens_rech/mathinfo/recherche/mathematique/outil.html. Conclusions: The local FDR associated with each gene measures the probability that it is a false positive. It gives the opportunity to compute the FDR of any given group of clones (of the same gene) or genes pertaining to the same regulation network or the same chromosomic region.},

	title = {Analyse statistique de données biologiques à haut débit},
	abstract = {Les progrès technologiques des vingt dernières années ont permis l’avènement d'une biologie à haut-débit reposant sur l'obtention de données à grande échelle de façon automatique. Les statisticiens ont un rôle important à jouer dans la modélisation et l'analyse de ces données nombreuses, bruitées, parfois hétérogènes et recueillies à différentes échelles. Ce rôle peut être de plusieurs natures. Le statisticien peut proposer de nouveaux concepts ou méthodes inspirées par les questions posées par cette biologie. Il peut proposer une modélisation fine des phénomènes observés à l'aide de ces technologies. Et lorsque des méthodes existent et nécessitent seulement une adaptation, le rôle du statisticien peut être celui d'un expert, qui connaît les méthodes, leurs limites et avantages. Le travail présenté dans cette thèse se situe à l'interface entre mathématiques appliquées et biologie, et relève plutôt des deuxième et troisième type de rôles mentionnés.Dans une première partie, j’introduis différentes méthodes développées pour l'analyse de données biologiques à haut débit, basées sur des modèles à variables latentes. Ces modèles permettent d'expliquer un phénomène observé à l'aide de variables cachées. Le modèle à variables latentes le plus simple est le modèle de mélange. Les deux premières méthodes présentées en sont des exemples: la première dans un contexte de tests multiples et la deuxième dans le cadre de la définition d'un seuil d'hybridation pour des données issues de puces à ADN. Je présente également un modèle de chaînes de Markov cachées couplées pour la détection de variations du nombre de copies en génomique prenant en compte de la dépendance entre les individus, due par exemple à une proximité génétique. Pour ce modèle, nous proposons une inférence approchée fondée sur une approximation variationnelle, l'inférence exacte ne pouvant pas être envisagée dès lors que le nombre d'individus augmente. Nous définissons également un modèle à blocs latents modélisant une structure sous-jacente par bloc de lignes et colonnes adaptées à des données de comptage issue de l'écologie microbienne. Les données issues de méta-codebarres ou de métagénomique correspondent à l'abondance de chaque unité d'intérêt (par exemple micro-organisme) d'une communauté microbienne au sein d'environnement (rhizosphère de plante, tube digestif humain, océan par exemple). Ces données ont la particularité de présenter une dispersion plus forte qu'attendue sous les modèles les plus classiques (on parle de sur-dispersion). La classification croisée est une façon d'étudier les interactions entre la structure des communautés microbiennes et les échantillons biologiques dont elles sont issues. Nous avons proposé de modéliser ce phénomène à l'aide d'une distribution Poisson-Gamma et développé une autre approximation variationnelle pour ce modèle particulier ainsi qu'un critère de sélection de modèle. La flexibilité et la performance du modèle sont illustrées sur trois jeux de données réelles.Une deuxième partie est consacrée à des travaux dédiés à l'analyse de données de transcriptomique issues des technologies de puce à ADN et de séquençage de l’ARN. La première section concerne la normalisation des données (détection et correction de biais techniques) et présente deux nouvelles méthodes que j’ai proposées avec mes co-auteurs et une comparaison de méthodes à laquelle j’ai contribuée. La deuxième section dédiée à la planification expérimentale présente une méthode pour analyser les dispositifs dit en dye-switch.Dans une dernière partie, je montre à travers deux exemples de collaboration, issues respectivement d'une analyse de gènes différentiellement exprimés à partir de données issues de puces à ADN, et d'une analyse du traductome chez l'oursin à partir de données de séquençage de l'ARN, la façon dont les compétences statistiques sont mobilisées et la plus-value apportée par les statistiques aux projets de génomique.},
