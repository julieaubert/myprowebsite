My research and teaching activities concern the development and application of statistical and computational methods to address problems in life sciences and more particularly in (microbial) ecology involving omics data.

**Statistical Methods in Molecular Biology**

\- Design, normalisation and analysis of gene expression experiments based on DNA microarray.

\- Design and analysis of high-throughput gene expression experiments based on next-generation sequencing: mRNA-Seq for transcriptome analysis.

\- Comparative Metagenomics based on next-generation sequencing data.

**Statistical Methods in Microbial Ecology**

\- Design and analysis of amplicon-based metagenomic data

\- Biclustering using Latent Block Model

Application to microbial ecology, plant-microbial communities interactions in the rhizosphere or soil microbial communities.
