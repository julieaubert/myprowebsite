A collection of Poisson LogNormal models for multivariate count data analysis

The Poisson lognormal model and variants can be used for a variety of multivariate problems when count data are at play (including PCA, LDA and network inference for count data). The PLNmodels implements efficient algorithms to fit such models accompanied with a set of functions for visualization and diagnostic.
