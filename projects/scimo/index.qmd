Package developed by Antoine Bichat and available on [Github](https://github.com/abichat/scimo) and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=scimo)

Omics data (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, metagenomics...) offer a detailed and multi-dimensional perspective on the molecular components and interactions within complex biological (eco)systems. Analyzing these data requires adapted procedures, which are implemented as steps according to the `recipes` package.
